## GDP-PTL-Correlation 

* After going through some data of the nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Brazil month-wise (source: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BRALORSGPNOSTSAM ), We tried to find the relation between the normalized GDP trends of Brazil and the PTL (Passengers Transported) of Sao Paulo and found out high correlation between them.

* If we compare PTL with the GDP of 1 month prior, the correlation between GDP and PTL reaches 0.8 .Hence using 1 month past GDP can be a very good indicator of the upcoming month's PTL trends.
