    """
    The São Paulo city subway system comprises 6 lines with 91 stations.
    Every day on average more than 4 million people are transported. 
    Although the system is under continuous update with new lines and stations 
    being constructed, the passenger demand is still higher than transportation 
    capacity in critical times every day. Only recently in the last years,
    the data for passenger demand has been opened to public access.
    There is no open monitoring system, dashboards, or predictive models
    to help the people and community decision-makers to understand the
    evolution and forecast the passenger demand for better urban planning.
