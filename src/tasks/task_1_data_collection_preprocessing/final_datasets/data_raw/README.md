# This folder contains the final datasets that should be used by the other teams
- Before you post a new dataset, check if the data are already in another dataset.
- If you think your dataset is better than the one already on the folder, please share why in our slack channel so the team could decide wich one should be here.
- Check our Notion for the Feature's Schema. Does your dataset follow the schema?
- Follow this pattern for the file name: line_dataset_year where:
1. line = l + line number, with 2 digits. Check Notion for line's number. Ex.: l01
2. dataset: Where the data came from? Passengers transported by line = ptl, Passengers entry by line = pel, Passengers entry by station = pes. Ex.: l01_pel
3. year: Year with 2 digits. If the dataset is for the hole time span (2017-2023), use complete. Ex.: l1_pel_23 OR l3_pes_complete
