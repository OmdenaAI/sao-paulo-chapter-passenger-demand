Below are some visualizations generated from the dataset. A demand pattern can be observed in almost all lines, with the exception of the silver line. The demand in 2022 increased by 9.43% compared to the year 2021.
Regarding passenger boarding per station, some visualizations are provided below.

An example of the increase in passenger growth on the Blue Line:

Regarding passenger entry, we saw an increase in people at all stations on the blue, red, green, and silver lines.

The stations that saw the greatest increase in demand were:

The questions I am seeking to answer are:

- If more people are using the subway, has the number of vehicles on the streets decreased?

- Are stations located in poorer neighborhoods in higher demand than those in wealthier areas?
